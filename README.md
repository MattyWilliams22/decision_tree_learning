## Specification

### The decision tree currently has the following form:

#### Nodes look like this:
    {"split_attribute": 3, "split_value": -59, "l_branch": {...}, "r_branch": {...}}

#### Leaves look like this:
    {"value": 1}


## To do list:

### Decision Tree Learning:

- Work out how to calculate entropy with continuous values (as opposed to discrete classes).
- Check all the functions work as intended.

### Tree Visualiser:

- Create a tree visualiser

### Evaluation Function:

- Create a 10-fold cross-validation function

### Classification Metrics Generator:

- Generate metrics
